**Hey there! *CODE&SPACE* is a minimalist theme designed for programmers.** Making heavy use of the [Space Mono font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) throughout the design, it is opinionated but customizable (see some of the screenshots above to get an idea). Features include:

* Minimal, **content-focused** design
* **Syntax highlighting** for the most common languages, with dozens of themes to choose from (courtesy of [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/))
* Customizable background and accent color
* Search
* Localization
* Optional **Google Analytics** integration (tracking script not loaded unless you fill in your tracking ID)
* Valid semantic HTML5 markup (that is, if you exclude the stuff Tumblr inserts into the page after processing the theme)
* Source code licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/doersino/Tumblr-Themes#license-mit) and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/doersino/Tumblr-Themes)

You can install the theme [from the Theme Garden](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/40771).
