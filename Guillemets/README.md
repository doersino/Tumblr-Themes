This is Guillemetsâ€”a minimalistic theme featuring fully customizable colors. You can literally change the tint of every pixel (except photos and videos, of course)! Also, this theme uses the Open Sans webfont, which looks beautiful on the screen and is perfectly legible.

This lovely theme supports all post types (and large photos are 600 pixels wide!), has optional infinite scrolling and lets the user choose to display or hide the sidebar (you can choose to display it always, though).
