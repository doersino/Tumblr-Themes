# Tumblr Themes

The source code of all Tumblr themes I've [submitted to the Theme Garden](https://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/noahdoersing), listed here in reverse chronological order of initial release:

## Miscellaneous

The [`unfinished/`](unfinished) directory contains some **themes in varying states of completion** â€“ I'm not likely to actually finish them, so if you like, go ahead and do whatever you want with them.

In [`Snippets.md`](Snippets.md), I've listed a few HTML5 code snippets that proved to be **handy for rapid Tumblr theme development**.
